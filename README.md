# Room-Occupancy-Detection-System
Solution to the inefficiency of locating vacant conference rooms in large buildings on college campuses in which to study or hold meetings. Developed an embedded systems solution using a microcontroller and passive infrared (PIR) sensor to autonomously sense the occupancy of a room and convey this information to users through web and mobile applications.
